# Oss GPT v.3

Oss GPT v.3 is a bot program similar to artificial intelligence. While most of its commands are in English, its data is in Arabic. It is capable of evolving and responding based on its database rules. It can calculate, understand, extract meanings, and assist you through the command `?help`. If asked or input a word it doesn't know, it will ask you to teach it, thus growing and learning through user interaction. It can display its data using the command `data`, delete it entirely or partially, and can be taught synonyms and antonyms as well. With future development, it will be able to accomplish many functions.

This project is part of the Artificial Intelligence department at Fluxa AI under B.Y PRO Software Company.
